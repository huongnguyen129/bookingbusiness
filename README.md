# **\[Business Name]: TemplateCart (placeholder name)**

(*We can brainstorm better ones after.*)

## 1. **Business Snapshot**

**TemplateCart** is a platform offering high-quality, ready-to-use booking templates tailored to niche small businesses — from solo yoga instructors to boutique salons — helping them save time, look professional, and convert more clients.

---

## 2. **Core Strategy**

### 2.1 **Value Proposition**

* **Problem We Solve:**
  Most small businesses struggle with clunky, generic booking systems that don’t fit their brand or are too expensive and hard to customize.

* **For Whom:**
  Service-based small businesses, especially solo entrepreneurs and under-5-person teams (e.g., nail techs, tutors, fitness coaches, estheticians).

* **Primary Benefit / Outcome:**
  Get a beautiful, functional booking experience without needing tech skills or expensive developers.

* **One-Sentence Value Proposition:**
  **We help small service businesses launch slick, branded booking systems fast — without the tech overwhelm.**

---

### 2.2 **Arbitrage (Market Opportunity)**

* **What gap/inefficiency are we exploiting?**
  Most booking tools are either too complex (Calendly, Acuity) or too generic (Google Forms), and don’t serve niche use-cases (e.g., 2-hour lash extensions, yoga class bundles, tutoring packages).

* **Why does this gap exist?**
  Because most platforms are built for scale, not customization. Small business owners are stuck duct-taping tools or paying for bloated features they don’t need. There's a generational/UX mismatch — younger clients expect sleek interfaces, but older business owners don’t have time to learn them.

* **How do we profit from it?**
  By offering **modular, vertical-specific template packs** with a one-time fee or subscription model. We deliver faster value at lower effort.

---

### 2.3 **Leverage (Internal + External)**

**Internal Leverage:**

* Modular Figma/HTML/No-Code template library
* AI-enhanced copy + form generator
* SEO content engine targeting niche bookings (“Best free booking forms for massage therapists”)
* Plug-and-play Zapier/Notion integrations
* Pre-designed “booking kits” for Gumroad / Etsy

**External Leverage:**

* Business owners urgently need time-saving, customer-friendly tools
* They’re emotionally invested in looking “legit” online
* Pandemic normalized online scheduling — expectations are high
* Seasonal launches (e.g., Valentine’s Day makeup bookings, back-to-school tutoring)

These levers help you **scale fast, close quick**, and **build brand authority** without high CAC.

### 4.2 **Brand Archetype**

### Brand Archetype

🧩 Why Creator?
You’re literally helping people create something — their branded booking experience — without needing to code or design. The Creator archetype fits because:

You’re empowering self-expression

Your templates are aesthetic, modular, and often seasonal

You appeal to small business owners who care about how things look
(lash techs, tutors, coaches, stylists = people who want beauty + control)

Creator Message: “Design a booking flow that feels like you.”

🔧 Why Everyman?
You're not trying to be Squarespace-level elite or corporate SaaS. You’re saying:

“This is for real people, who are busy, and want to stay booked.”

No jargon. No developer gatekeeping. Just fast, simple, helpful tools.

You normalize the anxiety around tech and make it accessible to all.

Everyman Message: “No stress. No snobbery. Just clean, simple tools that work.”

🧠 Combined Tone of Voice
Friendly and encouraging (Everyman)

Aspirational but not intimidating (Creator)

“We’ve got your back” meets “Make it yours”

🎨 Visual Identity (Archetype-Driven)
Pastel and warm neutrals

Soft, clean typography

Real screenshots > mockups

Emphasis on personalization, not perfection

🗣️ Core Messaging Pillars
“Look pro, without hiring one.”

“Start with a template. Make it yours.”

“Stay booked. Look good doing it.”
