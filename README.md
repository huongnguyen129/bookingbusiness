# 💍 **\[Business Name]: VowSites (or EverAfter, MarryMeWeb, VowPage)**


---

## 1. **Business Snapshot**

VowSites provides beautiful, plug-and-play wedding website templates for modern couples who want to share their story, manage RSVPs, and wow their guests — without dealing with clunky software or custom coding.

---

## 2. **Core Strategy**

### 2.1 **Value Proposition**

* **Problem We Solve:**
  Engaged couples are frustrated with slow, ugly, or overly technical wedding website platforms. They want something fast, stylish, and easy to use that still feels personal and beautiful.

* **For Whom:**
  Millennial and Gen Z couples planning their weddings — especially those who want control over aesthetics but no time or skill to build a site from scratch.

* **Primary Benefit / Outcome:**
  They get an instantly customizable wedding website that reflects their story, impresses guests, and saves hours of design work.

* **One-Sentence Value Proposition:**
  **“We help modern couples launch stunning wedding websites in minutes — no stress, no code, just love.”**

---

### 2.2 **Arbitrage (Market Opportunity)**

* **What gap/inefficiency are we exploiting?**
  Traditional platforms (Zola, The Knot) offer outdated templates and complicated UX. Others (Wix, Squarespace) are too complex for the average couple. You exploit the *gap between beauty and ease* — offering stunning modern templates built for *real-life, non-techy couples*.

* **Why does this gap exist?**
  Because existing solutions were built by platforms optimizing for registry and vendor sales — not user-centered design. There's also a generational gap in design aesthetics (Millennials and Gen Z want aesthetic, clean, minimal, shareable websites).

* **How do we profit or create value?**
  By offering:

  * Pre-designed site packs (one-time fee)
  * Add-ons (custom domain, RSVP syncing, photo galleries)
  * Premium bundles (email invites + site + registry linking)
    → Couples are *willing to pay* for a frictionless, elegant solution for this once-in-a-lifetime event.

### 2.3 **Leverage**

**Internal Leverage:**

* Plug-and-play template system (Framer/Webflow/Notion/HTML)
* SEO blog targeting long-tail keywords (“minimalist wedding website,” “free RSVP templates”)
* Creator partnerships with wedding TikTokers/Instagram planners
* Digital product distribution via Etsy, Gumroad, and your own platform
* AI copy assistant: auto-fill bios, love stories, schedules

**External Leverage:**

* High emotional urgency (“We just set the date!”)
* Short purchase window (couples spend heavily in 6–9 months)
* Guests as organic distribution (each visitor sees the site → shares with friends)
* High referral potential: “Where did you get your wedding website??” → easy viral loop

## 4. **Influence & Brand Strategy**

### 4.1 **Cialdini’s Principles of Persuasion**

* **Social Proof:**
  “Over 10,000 couples hosted their dream day on VowSites.”
  Screenshots from real weddings. TikTok UGC showcasing setup.
  Instagram stories of customer testimonials.

* **Authority:**
  “Built by designers and wedding planners who’ve helped 100+ couples go digital beautifully.”
  Design awards? Portfolio previews? Consider badge-style authority visuals.

* **Unity:**
  “Made by two wedding creatives who couldn’t find a site builder that felt modern, personal, and fun — so we built our own.”

* **Reciprocity:**
  Offer a *free wedding website starter guide* or *template chooser quiz*.
  Bonus: “Free site preview — no signup needed.”

* **Scarcity:**
  “Seasonal site designs — only available through this month.”
  Or “Launch special: 50% off the first 100 users.”

---

### 4.2 **Brand Archetype: Lover + Creator**

* **Why This Fits:**
  Weddings are emotional, aesthetic, and deeply personal. The Lover archetype captures the romance and warmth; the Creator supports the beauty and self-expression.

* **Tone of Voice:**
  Joyful, warm, design-savvy, playful but sincere.
  Think: *“Your love, your site. Built with heart.”*

* **Visual Style:**

  * Soft color palette (blush, sage, muted tones)
  * Minimalist typography
  * Showcase of templates per vibe (Boho, Classic, Indie, Modern, Cultural)

* **Core Messaging Style:**
  “Create a wedding website that feels like your love story — modern, meaningful, and made just for you.”

## 5. **Micro Sales Funnel Copy Starters**

* **Awareness:**
  “Planning your wedding and hate the idea of an ugly RSVP link?”
* **Consideration:**
  “See how 3 couples used VowSites to share their story and wow their guests.”
* **Conversion:**
  “Pick a template. Add your story. Done. Try free today.”
* **Loyalty/Referral:**
  “Refer another couple and get a \$10 registry credit or custom domain free.”
